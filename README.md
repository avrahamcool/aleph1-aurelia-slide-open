# `aleph1-aurelia-slide-open`

This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia-cli](https://github.com/aurelia/cli).

This Aurelia plugin project has a built-in dev app (with CLI built-in bundler and RequireJS) to simplify development.

1. The local `src/` folder, is the source code for the plugin.
2. The local `dev-app/` folder, is the code for the dev app, just like a normal app bootstrapped by aurelia-cli.
3. You can use normal `au run` and `au test` in development just like developing an app.
4. You can use aurelia-testing to test your plugin, just like developing an app.
5. To ensure compatibility to other apps, always use `PLATFORM.moduleName()` wrapper in files inside `src/`. You don't need to use the wrapper in `dev-app/` folder as CLI built-in bundler supports module name without the wrapper.

Note aurelia-cli doesn't provide a plugin skeleton with Webpack setup (not yet), but this plugin can be consumed by any app using Webpack, or CLI built-in bundler, or jspm.

## Build Plugin

Run `au build-plugin`. This will transpile all files from `src/` folder to `dist/native-modules/` and `dist/commonjs/`.

For example, `src/index.ts` will become `dist/native-modules/index.js` and `dist/commonjs/index.js`.

## Run dev app

Run `au run`, then open `http://localhost:9000`

To open browser automatically, do `au run --open`.

To change dev server port, do `au run --port 8888`.

To change dev server host, do `au run --host 127.0.0.1`


**PS:** You could mix all the flags as well, `au run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7070 --open`
